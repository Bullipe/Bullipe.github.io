## 🤖 AI and the Future of Academia
Given the profound influence AI is anticipated to have over the next two decades, I am of the belief that it is incumbent upon researchers, teachers, and students alike to remain at the cutting edge of this technological wave. Check out my Medium article [here](https://medium.com/@bullipereddy/chatgpt-and-academic-research-a-valuable-ally-or-a-mere-distraction-409ba78d3be9) where I delve into how ChatGPT presents an early glimpse into the benefits of integrating AI tools into academic research.
