## 🚀 About Me
I am a final year doctoral candidate specializing in Accounting at the Indian School of Business (ISB) and concurrently a research specialist in Accounting Information and Management at the Kellogg School of Management. 

## 🔬 Research Interests
Economics of intangible capital, financial accounting, Machine learning. I use state-of-the-art tools like machine learning and multilevel modelling to add new perspectives to financial accounting research.

## 📚 Teaching Philosophy
I strive to create a learning environment that nurtures curiosity, promotes critical thinking, and fosters diversity and inclusivity. In the age of artificial intelligence, I am adapting my pedagogical strategies to effectively prepare students for a digitally enhanced future.

## 🤖 AI and the Future of Academia
Given the profound influence AI is anticipated to have over the next two decades, I am of the firm belief that it is incumbent upon researchers, teachers, and students alike to remain at the cutting edge of this technological wave. Check out my Medium article [here](link) where I delve into how ChatGPT presents an early glimpse into the benefits of integrating AI tools into academic research.
