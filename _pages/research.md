### Valuing Internally Generated Intangible Capital Using a Machine Learning Approach
*Job Market Paper*

Current GAAP regulations prohibit the capitalization of firms' intangible investments, leading to a widening gap between what is reported on the books and what is considered valuable by the market. I provide a new measure of a firm’s in-house intangible capital based on a machine learning approach. My approach explicitly considers three distinctive features of intangible investments: i) they do not erode with use; 2) they often interact with other intangible investments to create additional value; and 3) they can be simultaneously launched in multiple markets with minimal capital expenditures. The ML estimates outperform as-reported values and extant linear-cost-accumulation models in better explaining cross-sectional variation in enterprise values, predicting future investments, and earning higher HML value-factor portfolio returns.

### Globalization and profitability of US firms
*With [Ravi Jagannathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Jagannathan) and [Swaminathan Sridharan](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/sridharan_swaminathan.aspx)*

China’s admission to the WTO in December 2001 heralded an era of increased globalization of trade, increasing import competition in the domestic markets and export opportunities for US firms. The profitability of S&P 500 Index firms as measured by the ratio of aggregate Earnings Before Interest and Taxes to aggregate Sales (EBIT Margin), a proxy for market power in the aggregate, increased significantly from an average of 11.2% during 1984-2001 to 12.4% during 2002-2019.  This is driven by their foreign EBIT Margin increasing from an average of 10.8% to 15.5%.  Our findings highlight the need for separating foreign and domestic segments when examining whether the market power of firms has changed over time.

### Types of Component Auditors and Shareholder Ratification of the Auditor
*With Sriniwas Mahapatro*

The PCAOB's Rule 3211 mandates firms to disclose the types of component auditors used and their contribution to the overall audit of firms. Within this context, we study the effect of types of component auditors on shareholder dissatisfaction.  Using a difference-in-differences framework, We find that MNCs reporting the use of large component auditors (LCAs, or component auditors contributing materially to the audit) have 17% lower shareholder voting against (or abstaining from) auditor ratification. The effect is more pronounced in firms with high institutional ownership and non-specialist principal auditors. No such effects occur with small component auditors (SCAs). Our results support the view that, on average, LCAs offer higher `local' benefits and impose lower coordination costs compared to SCAs.

### Estimation of Earnings Response Coefficients using Bayesian Hierarchical Models
*With [Sanjay Kallapur](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xa0GKZoAAAAJ&hl=en)*

Accounting parameters such as earnings response coefficients (ERC) are generally heterogeneous across firms. When panel data is available, the parameters are typically estimated using OLS with either pooled data which ignores parameter heterogeneity or using firm-specific observations, which tends to give noisy estimates. An alternative is to use Bayesian hierarchical models, which preserve parameter heterogeneity but have the advantage of being less noisy than firm-specific OLS. In this study, using a sample of 301 firms, we compare the results from three Bayesian hierarchical models to OLS-based firm-specific ERCs. Our results show that the Bayesian models produce ERCs that reduce the number of negative ERCs from 48 to 6 and lower mean squared error in a hold-out sample by more than 90%.

### Tackling Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Earnings Management Detection


I examine the traditional methodologies used in detecting earnings management activities. On the one hand, firm-specific longitudinal regressions, despite being effective in accounting for operational environment and financial reporting practices, often suffer from a high degree of variance in estimations and difficulties associated with small sample sizes. On the other hand, industry-level regressions, while encompassing industry-wide influences, grapple with interpretational challenges and a propensity to ignore the natural reversal of the accrual process, yielding high bias. In response, I propose a three-level, nested model as an innovative solution. With firm-years nested within firms and firms within industries, this model is predicated on the heterogeneity of coefficients, achieving a balanced trade-off between bias and variance.
