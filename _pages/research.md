It suggests a method that accounts for non-linear payoffs and synergistic effects often encountered in intangible investments. This method enhances the prediction accuracy for present market enterprise values and future patent values in comparison to conventional linear models. [Read More](link-to-paper)

### Estimation of Earnings Response Coefficients using Bayesian Hierarchical Models
*With Sanjay Kallapur*

This paper introduces Bayesian hierarchical models for the estimation of earnings response coefficients (ERC), aiming to preserve parameter heterogeneity and yield less noisy results than firm-specific OLS. A sample of 301 firms is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Bayesian models. [Read More](link-to-paper)

## Work-in-progress

### Tackling Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Earnings Management Detection
*With Andrew Leone*

This work-in-progress scrutinizes traditional methodologies used in detecting earnings management activities. It proposes a three-level, nested model to address issues of bias and variance commonly found in firm-specific longitudinal and industry-level regressions. The proposed model captures firm-specific, industry-wide, and temporal factors, offering a more holistic understanding of earnings management. [Read More](link-to-paper)
